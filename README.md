# wdf_kernel_driver
this is a network realated kernel mode driver, this project I started inside another project so I externed it to this repo 

to use this driver you need to load the driver open and communicate with it through i/o by sending a filter struct followed by the filtering content(if there is) 

* this project is still in development and may crash the os
